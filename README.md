**A window manager**

![Lines of code](https://www.aschey.tech/tokei/github.com/kosude/awm)


A highly configurable and lightweight X (xcb) window manager for use on Linux systems.

The aim is to have a basic floating window manager (eventually with compositing support) that behaves in a way somewhat similar to Windows, with the
difference that it runs on an operating system that doesn't hate you.

For more information, check out the [online documentation](https://kosude.github.io/awm).
