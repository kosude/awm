What is Awm?
------------

Awm (creative acronym for *'a window manager'*) is a highly configurable and lightweight X window manager for use on Linux systems.

The aim is to have a basic floating window manager (eventually with compositing support) that behaves in a way somewhat similar to Windows, with the
difference that it runs on an operating system that doesn't hate you.
